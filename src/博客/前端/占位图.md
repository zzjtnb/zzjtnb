The Lorem Ipsum for photos

![354](https://picsum.photos/536/354)

## Easy to use, stylish placeholders

Just add your desired image size (width & height) after our URL, and you'll get a random image.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300
```

To get a square image, just add the size.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200
```

## Specific Image

Get a specific image by adding `/id/{image}` to the start of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300
```

You can find a list of all the images [here](https://picsum.photos/images).

## Static Random Image

Get the same random image every time based on a seed, by adding `/seed/{seed}` to the start of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300
```

## Grayscale

Get a grayscale image by appending `?grayscale` to the end of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300?grayscale
```

## Blur

Get a blurred image by appending `?blur` to the end of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300/?blur
```

You can adjust the amount of blur by providing a number between **1** and **10**.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300/?blur=2
```

![354](https://picsum.photos/id/1060/536/354?blur=2)

## Advanced Usage

You may combine any of the options above.

For example, to get a specific image that is grayscale and blurred.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/id/870/200/300?grayscale&blur=2
```

To request multiple images of the same size in your browser, add the `random` query param to prevent the images from being cached:

``` html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=1">
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200/300?random=2">
```

If you need a file ending, you can add `.jpg` to the end of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300.jpg
```

To get an image in the WebP format, you can add .webp to the end of the url.

``` BASH
https://picsum.photos/200/300.webp
```
